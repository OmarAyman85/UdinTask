# Real-Time Multiplayer Tap Game

A fast-paced, real-time multiplayer tap game built with Angular and Socket.IO. Players compete by rapidly tapping their keyboard keys, and the game tracks scores and declares a winner after a timed round.

## Features

- Real-time multiplayer gameplay using WebSockets (Socket.IO)
- Player management with join/leave notifications
- Countdown timer before the game starts
- 15-second timed game rounds with live tap counts
- Prevents key hold; requires finger lift between taps
- Real-time winner announcement displayed on the game UI
- Clean Angular frontend with reactive UI updates
- Simple and scalable Node.js backend with Socket.IO for real-time events

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Angular 15+, TypeScript, Socket.IO client
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.IO server
- **Communication**: WebSockets via Socket.IO
- **Development**: npm, Angular CLI

## Project Structure
```

└── ... # Other Angular app files and modules

````

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm (Node package manager)
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd backend
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Angular development server:

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

### Configuration

- Update the socket URL in `src/environments/environment.ts` to point to your backend server URL (default: `http://localhost:3000`).

```ts
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  socketUrl: "http://localhost:3000",
};
```

## How to Play

1. Open the frontend app in your browser.
2. Enter a username and click **Join**.
3. Click **START GAME** to signal you're ready.
4. Wait for the countdown timer.
5. Once the game starts, tap any key rapidly — each tap counts!
6. After 15 seconds, the game ends and the winner is displayed.

## Code Highlights

- **Backend** uses Socket.IO to manage player connections and real-time game events.
- **Frontend** listens for server events to update UI state and sends tap events on key presses.
- The tap logic ensures only single taps are counted, preventing key hold cheating.
- The UI shows live countdown timers before and during the game.
- Winner is displayed dynamically on the page, not as alerts.

## Future Improvements

- Add user authentication for persistent profiles
- Implement leaderboards and player stats
- Support mobile touch input for tapping
- Add sound effects and animations for enhanced experience
- Deploy backend and frontend to cloud platforms
