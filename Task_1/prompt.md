# Project Collaboration Prompt Log

This document captures the conversation history and prompts exchanged during the development of the Sokoban game clone project using Angular. It serves both as a record of the process and a reference for future improvements or audits.

---

## Initial Project Request

**User:**  
I want to enhance this HTML code and make it semantic and more professional:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="controls">
    <button (click)="resetLevel()">ðŸ”„ Reset Puzzle</button>
  </div>

  <h2 *ngIf="winMessage">{{ winMessage }}</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div *ngFor="let row of baseGrid; let y = index" class="row">
      <span *ngFor="let col of row; let x = index" class="cell">
        {{ getTileDisplay(x, y) }}
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
````

---

## Semantic and Professional Enhancement

**Assistant:**
I improved the markup by using semantic elements like `<main>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<article>`, and ARIA roles to enhance accessibility. I replaced generic `<div>`s and `<span>`s where appropriate and added keyboard navigation support with `tabindex` and `aria` attributes.

---

## ARIA Property Binding Errors

**User:**
I'm getting these errors:

- Can't bind to 'aria-rowindex' since it isn't a known property of 'div'.ngtsc(-998002)
- Can't bind to 'aria-colindex' since it isn't a known property of 'div'.ngtsc(-998002)

---

## ARIA Binding Fix and Styling

**Assistant:**
I explained that ARIA attributes like `aria-rowindex` and `aria-colindex` must be bound as plain HTML attributes instead of Angular property bindings, so I switched to attribute binding with `[attr.aria-rowindex]`. Also, I added CSS styles for the grid and cells, ensuring cells are square and centered, and fixed the black bar issue by removing extra borders and adjusting widths.

---

## Adjusting Grid Size and Layout

**User:**
The board is too big and causes scrolling. Can you make it smaller so it fits 75% of the screen without scrolling? Also, the player emoji is too small.

---

## Responsive Grid with Larger Player

**Assistant:**
I adjusted the CSS to set the container width to 75vw (viewport width) max, limited max-height to 75vh to avoid vertical scrolling, used CSS Grid with `grid-template-columns` for even cells, and increased font size for the player emoji so itâ€™s visually prominent inside each cell.

---

## Puzzle Solvability Concern

**User:**
How can I make sure every generated puzzle is solvable, not just random?

---

## Ensuring Puzzle Solvability Guidance

**Assistant:**
I explained that random generation often leads to unsolvable puzzles. Suggested approaches include generating puzzles by simulating reverse moves from the solved state, or using a solver algorithm to verify solvability after generation. I offered to help implement a solver-based validation or reverse puzzle generator if desired.

---

## Button Alignment Request

**User:**
I want the reset button to be horizontally centered (halfway) within the controls area, not aligned to the left.

---

## Button Centering Solution

**Assistant:**
I updated the `.controls` CSS to `justify-content: center;` and provided the updated `.btn-reset` styles with a polished blue color, hover effects, and rounded corners.

---

## Making Emoji Fill Entire Cell

**User:**
I want the emoji inside each cell to fill the entire cell area, not just part of it.

---

## Full-Cell Emoji Styling

**Assistant:**
I set the `.cell` font size to `3rem`, increased height, line-height, and used `display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;` to perfectly center and scale the emoji in each grid cell.

---

## Final README.md Request with Constraints

**User:**
Now that youâ€™ve seen the whole project, generate a `README.md` for the repo, including these constraints:

- Create a Sokoban game clone using your preferred AI provider.
- The player sprite must be able to move in all directions.
- Blocks can only be pushed, not pulled.
- Only one block can be pushed at a time.

---

## Complete README.md with Constraints

**Assistant:**
I created a detailed professional README including sections: Overview, Features, Constraints (explicitly listing your rules), Getting Started, How to Play, Project Structure, Known Limitations, Future Improvements, and License.

---

## Final prompt.md Request

**User:**
Finally, generate a `prompt.md` file containing our prompts â€” but donâ€™t just dump them raw; write them as if you were working with me from the start, capturing the conversation flow naturally.

---

## prompt.md Generation (this file)

**Assistant:**
Generated this detailed, narrative-style prompt log documenting your requests and my responses step-by-step, showing the evolution of the project from semantic HTML improvements, accessibility fixes, styling adjustments, gameplay constraints, to documentation.
